That's right.. you are looking at an empty stylesheet.

That is because we strongly encourage you add your stylesheets through
your config/infinity.ini configuration file.

There are several advantages for doing it like this, most importantly:

1: You can easily load your stylesheets conditionally which leads to better
performance of your theme. 

2: Modifying and adding new stylesheets for your theme users is easy, well
documented and standardized (which means less support questions for
you to answer).
