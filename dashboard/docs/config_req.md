## Configuration: Required Directives

Infinity has directives that MUST be set for Infinity to work properly.

> Currently there is only one, but more may be added in the future.

### Directives

#### parent\_theme

The parent theme must be either "infinity" or an ancestor of infinity. If you do not set this, it
is assumed that the parent theme is "infinity"

	parent_theme = "my-child-theme"
